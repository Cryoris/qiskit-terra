    Since Python 3.6 dictionaries are insertion ordered, i.e. retrieving the keys of a
    dictionary will return an iterable mirroring the order in which the keys are inserted.
    In the QuantumCircuit, Parameters are stored in a dictionary so the information of
    the insertion order is present.
    Currently, we discard this information at two points:
      1) if ``QuantumCircuit.parameters`` is called we return a set of the parameters,
         which can change the order
      2) if we create a ``Gate`` or ``Instruction`` out of a circuit, the parameters are
         actively sorted by name
    The new behaviour ensures that parameters are insertion-sorted by
      1) returning a list, not set, of the parameter dictionary keys
      2) not re-sorting the parameters of the circuit
    This feature mirrors the behaviour some users might expect and is necessary for changes
    in Aqua introduced by the Ansatz object.
