    Added :func:`.grover_operator` to construct a Grover operator circuit, used in e.g.
    Grover's algorithm and amplitude estimation/amplification. This function is similar to
    :class:`.GroverOperator`, but does not require choosing the implementation of the
    multi-controlled X gate a-priori and let's the compiler choose the optimal decomposition
    instead.
