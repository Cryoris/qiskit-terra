    Fix a bug where creating a new instance of a SciPy optimizer has overwritten the 
    settings of a previously created instance of the same type. For example, previously::

      from qiskit.algorithms.optimmizers import COBYLA
      optimizer = COBYLA(maxiter=1)
      reconstructed = COBYLA(**optimizer.settings)

    Created a new `COBYLA` instance with the default of `maxiter=1000` and additionally reset 
    the iterations of the original `optimizer` instance to 1000 as well.
