    Fixed a bug in :class:`.SolovayKitaev` where on some platforms certain gates led to
    an accumulation of roundoff errors and to the failure of an orthogonality check.
    Now, all Qiskit :class:`.Gate` objects pass without raising errors.
    Fixed `#9437 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9437>`__.
