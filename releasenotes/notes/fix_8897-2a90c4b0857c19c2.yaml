fixes:
  - |
    Fixed :meth:`.Statevector.evolve` and :meth:`.DensityMatrix.evolve` which
    would raise an exeception for nested subsystem evolution for non-qubit
    subsystems.
    Fixed `#8897 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8897>`_
  - |
    Fixed a bug in :meth:`.Statevector.evolve` where subsystem evolution
    would return the incorrect value in certain cases where there are 2 or more
    than non-evolved subsystems with different subsystem dimensions.
    Fixed `#8899 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8899>`_
