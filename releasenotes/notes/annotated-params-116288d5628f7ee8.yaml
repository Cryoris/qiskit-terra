    Add support for :meth:`.AnnotatedOperation.params`, which enables
    circuit-level parameter handling (such as binding parameters) for
    annotated operations.

    Fix a series of issues when controlling parameterized standard gates.
    The controlled version of some gates (e.g. :class:`.RXXGate` or
    :class:`.RYGate` for more than 1 control) cannot be synthesized if
    they contain unbound parameters. Previously, this raised an error, but
    now we create an :class:`.AnnotatedOperation` as placeholder. This
    allows to insert the controlled gate into a circuit, bind the parameters
    at a later stage, and then synthesize the operation.
