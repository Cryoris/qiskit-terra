    Introduces the ``Solovay-Kitaev`` class, that adds support for running the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm
    as a ``TranspilerPass``. The Solovay-Kitaev theorem [1] states that any single qubit gate can be approximated to
    arbitrary precision by a set of fixed single-qubit gates, if the set generates a dense
    subset in :math:`SU(2)`. This is an important result, since it means that any single-qubit
    gate can be expressed in terms of a discrete, universal gate set that we know how to implement
    fault-tolerantly. Therefore, the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm allows us to take any
    non-fault tolerant circuit and rephrase it in a fault-tolerant manner.
