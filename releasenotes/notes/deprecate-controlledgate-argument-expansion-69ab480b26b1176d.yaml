    Deprecate the argument expansion on single controlled qubit gates, such as for example 

    .. code-block::python

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

        circuit = QuantumCircuit(4)
        circuit.cx([0, 1], [2, 3])

    which would previously create two CX gates, one controlled on qubit 0 and acting on qubit 2
    and a second one contolled on qubit 1 and acting on qubit 3. Instead, the circuit methods 
    must now be called once for each gate as 

    .. code-block::python

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

        circuit = QuantumCircuit(4)
        circuit.cx(0, 2)
        circuit.cx(1, 3)
