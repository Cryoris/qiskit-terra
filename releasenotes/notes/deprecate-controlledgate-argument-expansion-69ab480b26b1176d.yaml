    In future passing multiple qubit arguments to controlled gate methods created multi-controlled
    (and optionall multi-target) gates. The current behavior, where multiple arguments are
    broadcasted to create multiple single-control single-target gates, is pending deprecation.

    For example::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

      circuit = QuantumCircuit(3)
      circuit.cx([0, 1], 2)

    currently creates two CX gates, one controlled on qubit 0 and acting on qubit 2
    and a second one contolled on qubit 1 and acting on qubit 2. In future, this will create a
    CCX gate, controlled on qubits 0 and 1 and acting on 2.

    To construct two gates in future, the methods have to be called twice explicitly::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

      circuit = QuantumCircuit(3)
      circuit.cx(0, 2)
      circuit.cx(1, 2)

    The future behavior for multicontrolled gates can already be enabled as::

      from qiskit.future import multicontrolled_gates

    which also silences pending deprecation warnings.
