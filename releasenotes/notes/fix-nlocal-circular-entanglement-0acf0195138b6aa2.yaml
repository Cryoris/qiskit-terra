    Fix the ``'circular'`` entanglement in the ``NLocal`` circuit class for the edge
    case where the circuit has the same size as the entanglement block (e.g. a two-qubit
    circuit and CZ entanglement gates). In this case there should only be one entanglement
    gate, but there was accidentially added a second one in the inverse direction as the 
    first.
