upgrade:
  - |
    Remove the `optimize` method from the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.Optimizer`
    classes, which is superseded by the `minimize` method as direct replacement.
    The one exception is :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.SPSA`, where the
    deprecation warning was not triggered so the method there is still kept.
deprecations:
  - |
    The :meth:`qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.SPSA.optimize` method is deprecated in
    favor of :meth:`qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.SPSA.minimize`, which can be used
    as direct replacement. Note that the `minimize` method returns a complete result
    object with more information than before available.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix the getter of :attr:`qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.OptimizerResult.nit`, which
    previously returned the number of jacobian evaluations instead of the number of iterations.
