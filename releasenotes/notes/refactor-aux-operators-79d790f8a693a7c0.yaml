    :func:`qiskit.algorithms.aux_ops_evaluator.eval_observables` is added that originates from
    a method previously residing in :class:`qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigen_solvers.VQE`. The
    method is general enough so that it can be used in other algorithms, for example time evolution
    algorithms. The method is also refactored to be more modular.
