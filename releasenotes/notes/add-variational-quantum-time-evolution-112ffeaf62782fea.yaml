    Add algorithms for Variational Quantum Time Evolution that implement a new interface for
    Quantum Time Evolution. The feature supports real (:class:`qiskit.algorithms.VarQRTE`.) and
    imaginary (:class:`qiskit.algorithms.VarQITE`.) quantum time evolution according to a
    variational principle provided.
