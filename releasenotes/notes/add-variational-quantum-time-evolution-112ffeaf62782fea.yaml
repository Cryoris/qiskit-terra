    Add algorithms for Variational Quantum Time Evolution that implement a new interface for
    Qantum Time Evolution. The feature supports real
    (:class:`qiskit.algorithms.quantum_time_evolution.variational.VarQrte`.) and imaginary
    (:class:`qiskit.algorithms.quantum_time_evolution.variational.VarQite`.) quantum time evolution
    according to a variational principle provided or according to calculated gradient errors.
