    Added a Rust implementation of the :class:`.CommutationChecker` supporting:
    *  A library of commutations as an input that is queried before performing runtime-intensive matrix multiplications
    *  A commutation cache that stores commutation relations determined by the :class:`.CommutationChecker` (if that relation is not in the commutation library)
    *  Serialization

    Added a Rust implementation for composing unitary matrices by using the einsum notation
