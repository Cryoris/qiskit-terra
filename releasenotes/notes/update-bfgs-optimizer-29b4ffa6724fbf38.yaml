upgrade:
  - |
    Deleted the deprecated ``factr`` and ``epsilon`` arguments of the :class:`.L_BFGS_B` optimizer.
  - |
    Change the default of maximum number of allowed function evaluations in :class:`.L_BFGS_B`
    from 1000 to 15000 to match the SciPy default. This number also matches the default number 
    of iterations.
