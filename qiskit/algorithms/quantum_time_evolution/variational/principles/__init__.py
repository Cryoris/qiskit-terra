Principles (:mod:`qiskit.algorithms.quantum_time_evolution.variational.principles`)
=====================================================
It  contains a variety of variational principles which can be used to simulate quantum time
evolution by propagating the parameters of a parameterized quantum circuit.

These variational principles can be divided into two categories:
`Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution`_
  Given a Hamiltonian, a time and a variational ansatz, the variational principle describes a
  variational principle according to the normalized Wick-rotated Schroedinger equation.
`Variational Quantum Real Time Evolution`_
  Given a Hamiltonian, a time and a variational ansatz, the variational principle describes a
  variational principle according to the Schroedinger equation.
