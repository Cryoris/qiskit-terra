        Args:
            maxiter: The maximum number of iterations.
            blocking: If True, only accepts updates that improve the loss.
            allowed_increase: If blocking is True, this sets by how much the loss can increase
                and still be accepted. If None, calibrated automatically to be twice the
                standard deviation of the loss function.
            learning_rate: A generator yielding learning rates for the parameter updates,
                :math:`a_k`.
            perturbation: A generator yielding the perturbation magnitudes :math:`c_k`.
            resamplings: In each step, sample the gradient (and preconditioner) this many times.
            callback: A callback function passed information in each iteration step. The
                information is, in this order: the parameters, the function value, the number
                of function evaluations, the stepsize, whether the step was accepted.
            second_order: If True, use 2-SPSA instead of SPSA. In 2-SPSA, the Hessian is estimated
                additionally to the gradient, and the gradient is preconditioned with the inverse
                of the Hessian to improve convergence.
            hessian_delay: Start preconditioning only after a certain number of iterations.
                Can be useful to first get a stable average over the last iterations before using
                the preconditioner.
            lse_solver: The method to solve for the inverse of the preconditioner. Per default an
                exact LSE solver is used, but can e.g. be overwritten by a minimization routine.
            regularization: To ensure the preconditioner is symmetric and positive definite, the
                identity times a small coefficient is added to it. This generator yields that
                coefficient.
            perturbation_dims: The number of dimensions to perturb at once. Per default all
                dimensions are perturbed simulatneously.
            initial_hessian: The initial guess for the Hessian. By default the identity matrix
                is used.
            backend: A backend to evaluate the circuits, if the overlap function is provided as
                a circuit and the objective function as operator expression.
