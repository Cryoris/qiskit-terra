"""
Uniformly controlled gates (also called multiplexed gates).

These gates can have several control qubits and a single target qubit.
If the k control qubits are in the state |i> (in the computational basis),
a single-qubit unitary U_i is applied to the target qubit.

This gate is represented by a block-diagonal matrix, where each block is a
2x2 unitary:

    [[U_0, 0,   ....,        0],
     [0,   U_1, ....,        0],
                .
                    .
     [0,   0,  ...., U_(2^k-1)]]
