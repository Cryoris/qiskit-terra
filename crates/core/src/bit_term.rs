/// This is just the Rust-space representation.  We make a separate Python-space `enum.IntEnum` to
/// represent the same information, since we enforce strongly typed interactions in Rust, including
/// not allowing the stored values to be outside the valid `BitTerm`s, but doing so in Python would
/// make it very difficult to use the class efficiently with Numpy array views.  We attach this
/// sister class of `BitTerm` to `SparseObservable` as a scoped class.
///
/// # Representation
///
/// The `u8` representation and the exact numerical values of these are part of the public API.  The
/// low two bits are the symplectic Pauli representation of the required measurement basis with Z in
/// the Lsb0 and X in the Lsb1 (e.g. X and its eigenstate projectors all have their two low bits as
/// `0b10`).  The high two bits are `00` for the operator, `10` for the projector to the positive
/// eigenstate, and `01` for the projector to the negative eigenstate.
///
/// The `0b00_00` representation thus ends up being the natural representation of the `I` operator,
/// but this is never stored, and is not named in the enumeration.
///
/// This operator does not store phase terms of $-i$.  `BitTerm::Y` has `(1, 1)` as its `(z, x)`
/// representation, and represents exactly the Pauli Y operator; any additional phase is stored only
/// in a corresponding coefficient.
///
/// # Dev notes
///
/// This type is required to be `u8`, but it's a subtype of `u8` because not all `u8` are valid
/// `BitTerm`s.  For interop with Python space, we accept Numpy arrays of `u8` to represent this,
/// which we transmute into slices of `BitTerm`, after checking that all the values are correct (or
/// skipping the check if Python space promises that it upheld the checks).
///
/// We deliberately _don't_ impl `numpy::Element` for `BitTerm` (which would let us accept and
/// return `PyArray1<BitTerm>` at Python-space boundaries) so that it's clear when we're doing
/// the transmute, and we have to be explicit about the safety of that.
